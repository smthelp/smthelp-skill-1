 {"h": "Look at what is left on the manual line", "p": [
  "Walk to the end of a through-hole line and count the people. The radial and axial parts went in on machines an hour ago. What the operators are still pushing into boards is a short list of odd shapes: a 2×6 header, a stacked USB jack, a transformer, two X2 capacitors, a buzzer.",
  "Ask why those parts are still manual and the first answer is usually 'they are odd-form'. That is a description, not a reason."]},
 {"h": "The shape is rarely the obstacle", "p": [
  "Modern odd-form inserters can pick and insert almost any of those bodies. The real obstacle is that each part arrives in a different container. The header comes loose in a bag, the transformer in a tray, the IC in a tube, the capacitor on ammo tape. A machine can only insert what a feeder presents at a repeatable position.",
  "In the evaluations behind this page, one connector board had 18 odd-form lines in three packaging types, and a desktop board had 35 lines spread over bulk, reel, tape and tray. None of that is exotic. It is simply more variety than one feeder bank was designed for."]},
 {"h": "Sort the list by packaging first", "p": [
  "Before anyone argues about nozzles or cycle time, sort the odd-form list by how each part arrives. Bulk, tube, tray, radial tape, axial tape, embossed tape and coil. That single column decides the feeder family for every line.",
  "Then measure what the feeder will see: body length, width and height, lead pitch, lead count and lead diameter. Those numbers decide whether the standard model of that family works or a customized one is needed."]},
 {"h": "Ten feeder models, one per packaging", "p": [
  "This is how the Southern Machinery Customized Feeder Nozzle Catalog V03 is organised: tube (STF1003), tray (STP1001), vibratory bowl (SBF1001), belt (SBF2002), radial tape (SRF1001), axial tape (SAF1001), plus jumper wire, reel terminal, solder chip and label feeders. Each one is a base that is customized to the part.",
  "The quick-match table on this page applies the same sorting to 76 real component lines, so you can see how parts like yours were mapped."]},
 {"h": "Why the list gets shorter every project", "p": [
  "Once a feeder family is on your machine, every new board with the same packaging is a smaller step. The second bowl feeder is a track change, not a new project. Most lines find that the manual station shrinks board by board."]},
 {"h": "Start with your own list", "p": [
  "Take the odd-form lines still inserted by hand, add the packaging column and the dimensions, and send it for a free feasibility check. You get a per-line answer: feeder, nozzle and what needs a sample test."]},
])

P.append([
 {"h": "One column changes the whole review", "p": [
  "Most odd-form BOM reviews start with the part description. Start with the packaging column instead and the review gets shorter.",
  "The reason is mechanical. A feeder is a device that turns one container format into a part at a pick position. Change the container and you change the feeder, whatever the part is."]},
 {"h": "Where NPI reviews lose time", "p": [
  "When packaging is not recorded, the team discovers it at the line: the header that was supposed to be on tape arrives loose, the relay comes in a tray instead of a tube. The feeder plan is redone after the first trial.",
  "In one of the source lists the same buzzer type arrived in bulk on one board and in trays on another. Same component, two different feeders."]},
 {"h": "Six codes, six families", "p": [
  "Bulk parts go to a vibratory bowl or a belt feeder. Tubes go to a tube feeder. Trays go to a tray feeder. Radial tape goes to a radial tape feeder that cuts and forms the leads. Axial tape goes to an axial feeder that forms and trims. Wire, terminals, solder and labels on a coil each have a dedicated coil feeder.",
  "Embossed carrier tape is the exception: it usually runs on the host machine's own wide tape feeder, and the odd-form work is in the nozzle."]},
 {"h": "How the catalog maps them", "p": [
  "Catalog V03 gives one model per code: SBF1001 or SBF2002 for bulk, STF1003 for tubes (200–650 mm, several stacked), STP1001 for blister trays 150×150 to 200×300 mm, SRF1001 for radial tape at 12.7 or 15 mm hole pitch, SAF1001 for axial tape 35, 64 or 92 mm wide, and SJF1001, SRT7001, SSPC101 and SLF1001 for coils.",
  "Filter the quick-match table by packaging and you see the same mapping applied line by line."]},
 {"h": "Keep the column in every BOM", "p": [
  "Ask purchasing to keep the packaging code on the BOM for every odd-form line. It costs one column and it saves a trial run each time a board changes."]},

 {"h": "Three numbers, measured on the sample", "p": [
  "A datasheet tells you what a part can be. The feeder sees what the sample is. Before choosing a feeder model, measure three things on the real part: the body envelope, the lead pitch and the lead diameter."]},
 {"h": "Why datasheet numbers mislead", "p": [
  "In one evaluation sheet the column labelled lead width held the lead pitch on most lines and the body width on three others. A PTC described as P = 5 mm carried 13 mm in that column. Copy the wrong number into a feeder request and the forming mould is wrong.",
  "Half of the lines on another list had no dimensions at all, only a description and a packaging code. Those lines cannot be confirmed until someone measures a part."]},
 {"h": "What each number decides", "p": [
  "The body envelope, length × width × height, decides whether the part fits the track, bowl or tray of the standard model. The lead pitch decides the forming mould on a radial feeder and the hole pattern on the board. The lead diameter decides whether the cutter and forming tools of the feeder can handle the wire.",
  "Record overall height above the board as well; it matters for clearance under the head.",
  "Weigh heavy parts too. The bowl feeder publishes a range of 10–300 g, and a transformer or a large relay can sit near the top of it."]},
 {"h": "The envelopes in Catalog V03", "p": [
  "SRF1001 radial: 2×2×3 to 15×15×30 mm, lead core 0.3–1.0 mm, cut length 3–6 mm. STF1003 tube: 3×3×3 to 25×25×25 mm. SBF2002 belt: up to 20×20×20 mm. SBF1001 bowl: 3×3 to 50×50 mm and 10–300 g. STP1001 tray: up to 50×50×50 mm. SJF1001 jumper wire: Ø0.5–1.2 mm.",
  "The check-your-part box under the quick-match table compares your numbers with these envelopes."]},
 {"h": "A habit that pays back", "p": [
  "Keep a measured-dimension sheet for every odd-form part you qualify. The next board that reuses the part needs no new measurement and no new test."]},
 {"h": "Measure, then ask", "p": [
  "Measure the three numbers, add packaging, and send the sheet. Lines outside every envelope are where a customized feeder starts, and the sample test is free."]},

 {"h": "Two parts, two pick tools", "p": [
  "Put an aluminium electrolytic capacitor next to an open 2×6 pin header. Both are odd-form, both are THT, and they need completely different pick tools."]},
 {"h": "Where the insert actually fails", "p": [
  "Most odd-form insertion failures are not in the feeder or the inserter. They are in the moment the nozzle holds the part. A vacuum cup on an open header leaks and the part drops. A gripper that closes on a soft body tilts it, and the leads miss the holes.",
  "The evaluations behind this page record the nozzle choice per line: on the connector board, 12 of 18 lines were gripper and 6 vacuum."]},
 {"h": "A simple rule set", "p": [
  "If the part has a flat, closed top larger than the nozzle tip, start with vacuum: jacks, electrolytic capacitors, buzzers, many USB connectors.",
  "If the top is open, ribbed or too small, use a gripper on the body: pin headers, wafers, Y-capacitors, thermistors.",
  "If the part is heavy for its top area, prefer a gripper even when the top is flat.",
  "Axial parts are handled by their leads, not their body.",
  "Check one more thing before the trial: the pick surface after the feeder has presented the part. A bowl track or a tube end can rotate a part by a few degrees, and a gripper tolerates that better than a small vacuum tip."]},
 {"h": "What Southern Machinery builds", "p": [
  "Catalog V03 lists gripper nozzles with a fixed arm and a swing arm that grab odd shapes, for odd-form components, special connectors and hybrid circuits, and custom nozzles for THT parts with interchangeable rubber tips.",
  "The quick-match table shows the nozzle type per line so the nozzle column of your BOM can be filled in before the trial."]},
 {"h": "Reuse across boards", "p": [
  "A gripper designed for one header family usually serves every board that uses it. Keep a nozzle-to-part list and the next NPI starts with the nozzles already on the shelf."]},
 {"h": "Send the doubtful ones", "p": [
  "For parts where the rule set gives no clear answer, send five to ten samples. The free test decides gripper or vacuum on the real part."]},

 {"h": "The capacitor that is too wide", "p": [
  "An X2 safety capacitor of 27 × 30 × 14.5 mm with 22.5 mm lead pitch sits on many power-supply boards. It comes on ammo tape like any radial part. It does not fit a standard radial feeder."]},
 {"h": "Why the standard feeder stops", "p": [
  "Catalog V03 publishes the SRF1001 radial tape feeder for outlines from 2×2×3 to 15×15×30 mm. A 26.5 mm wide body is outside that envelope, and a 22.5 mm pitch needs its own forming mould.",
  "The evaluation of that power-supply board says the same thing in its own words: pending confirmation of the pitch, a custom feeder is needed. Four of its twelve lines were outside the standard envelope."]},
 {"h": "How to specify a customized feeder", "p": [
  "Give the feeder designer four things: the measured body, the lead pitch, the lead diameter and the tape (hole pitch 12.7 or 15 mm, ammo or reel). Add a photo of the part in the tape and of the board hole pattern.",
  "Then say how the part must be presented: lead length after cutting, whether it is inserted straight or bent, and the pick height on your machine.",
  "Ask for the result per part, not per feeder. A customized radial feeder that takes the X2 capacitor may also take the larger PTC thermistor on the same board, which saves a feeder slot."]},
 {"h": "Where it is built", "p": [
  "The catalog describes SRF1001 as customizable for odd-form and non-standard equipment, with tape cutting and component bending options. The same base, with wider guides and a new mould, is where a customized radial feeder starts.",
  "In the quick-match table such lines are marked 'to be confirmed'. That status is an invitation to test, not a refusal."]},
 {"h": "One design, many boards", "p": [
  "Power boards tend to reuse the same safety capacitors. A feeder customized for one X2 family usually covers the next design as well."]},
 {"h": "Send one tape strip", "p": [
  "Send a strip of the taped part and the board drawing. The feasibility check tells you in writing what the customized feeder needs."]},

 {"h": "Two ways to feed loose parts", "p": [
  "Loose connectors, trimmers and buzzers can be fed by a vibratory bowl or by a belt feeder. Both turn a pile into a row of parts at a pick point. They are not interchangeable."]},
 {"h": "Where bulk feeding goes wrong", "p": [
  "A bowl that is too aggressive bends delicate pins. A belt that cannot tell the part's direction delivers half the parts reversed. Either way the head picks a part it cannot insert."]},
 {"h": "Decide with four questions", "p": [
  "How big is the part? How heavy? How stiff are its pins? Can its direction be told from its shape?",
  "Small, light parts with physically distinct features suit a belt. Larger or heavier parts, parts that need polarity sorting or lead cutting, and parts with pins that bend easily suit a bowl with a dedicated track.",
  "In the connector-board evaluation behind this page, all twelve bulk lines fitted inside 20×20×20 mm, so the belt feeder is the first candidate and the bowl the alternative. One of them, a 2×4 power header 18.4 mm long, was still marked conditional and goes to a sample test before either is chosen."]},
 {"h": "The catalog numbers side by side", "p": [
  "SBF2002 belt feeder: connectors, buzzers, network ports, terminals and square capacitors from 3×3×3 to 20×20×20 mm, material selection and NG return, ±1 mm, 1.5–2 s, 850×140×260 mm and 12 kg. Unsuitable: pins that deform easily.",
  "SBF1001 bowl feeder: electronic components, hardware, plastic parts and connectors from 3×3 to 50×50 mm and 10–300 g, polarity sorting and lead cutting as options, ±0.5 mm, 0.8 s, single bowl 760×460×910 mm or front-and-rear bowls 1120×460×910 mm."]},
 {"h": "Plan for the next part", "p": [
  "A bowl track is specific to a part; the bowl and drive are not. A belt feeder can often take a related connector with small adjustments. Ask which parts of the feeder are reusable before choosing."]},

 {"h": "An answer you can file", "p": [
  "A feasibility check is only useful if it ends in a document an NPI engineer can file: each line, its feeder, its nozzle and what still needs proof."]},
 {"h": "Why verbal answers fail", "p": [
  "'Should be fine' becomes a problem in the first trial week. Without a written per-line result, nobody knows which parts were actually checked and which were assumed."]},
 {"h": "What to send", "p": [
  "The BOM lines that are still manual, with packaging, measured dimensions and quantity per board. Photos of each part, including leads and polarity mark. Five to ten samples of every line marked 'custom' or 'to be confirmed'.",
  "The insertion machine brand and exact model, with photos of the feeder rail and the free positions. Part numbers can stay internal; the description is enough.",
  "If dimensions are missing, say so. In one of the lists behind this page, none of the 35 lines carried measured dimensions; only the capacitor descriptions gave a size. Those lines were still mapped to a feeder family, but each one is marked for measurement before a model is confirmed."]},
 {"h": "What comes back", "p": [
  "Southern Machinery engineering maps every line to a feeder family and nozzle type, checks it against the Catalog V03 envelope, and runs doubtful parts on a feeder. Each line gets one of four results: fits the catalog model, needs customization of feeder or nozzle, needs a sample test, or is not possible in the current packaging.",
  "That is the same status column you see in the quick-match table."]},
 {"h": "A record for later boards", "p": [
  "Keep the result sheet with the BOM. When a part comes back on a new board, its feeder and nozzle are already known."]},

  "First, feeding alone: count parts fed, mis-presented parts and stops over a fixed number of cycles.",
