# FAQ
Q = [
 ("Which feeder do I need for an odd-form part?", "Start from the packaging: bulk goes to the SBF1001 bowl or SBF2002 belt, tubes to STF1003, trays to STP1001, radial tape to SRF1001, axial tape to SAF1001, coils to SJF1001, SRT7001 or SSPC101. Then check body size, pitch and lead diameter against that model's envelope in the quick-match table."),
 ("Do Southern Machinery feeders work with my insertion machine or SMT mounter?", "Every Catalog V03 model connects through an 8-core 16 mm aviation plug and runs with IO communication or stand-alone. The catalog shows installs on Panasonic CM602, JUKI, YAMAHA and Mirae odd-form machines; the exact mounting is confirmed from photos of your feeder rail."),
 ("What is the largest component a feeder can take?", "Up to 50×50×50 mm on the STP1001 tray feeder and 50×50 mm on the SBF1001 bowl (10–300 g). Tube parts go up to 25 mm, belt-fed parts up to 20 mm and radial taped parts up to 15×15×30 mm; anything larger is a customized feeder."),
 ("My X2 capacitor has a 22.5 mm pitch. Can it be fed?", "Not by the standard SRF1001, whose body envelope stops at 15 mm. Such lines are marked 'to be confirmed' in the table and handled as a customized radial feeder after a sample test."),
 ("When do I need a gripper nozzle instead of vacuum?", "When the part has no flat, sealed top: open pin headers, wafers, many connectors and Y-capacitors. Gripper nozzles with a fixed and a swing arm hold the body; parts with a flat top, such as jacks or electrolytic capacitors, usually take a vacuum nozzle with a custom tip."),
 ("How accurate is the feeding?", "As published in Catalog V03: ±0.2 mm radial and label feeders, ±0.3 mm axial, ±0.5 mm tube, bowl, terminal and solder, ±1 mm tray and belt."),
 ("Is the feasibility test really free?", "Yes. Send the BOM with dimensions and packaging, samples of doubtful parts and your machine model; you receive a written per-line result before any order."),
 ("What is the lead time?", "Catalog V03 does not state one. Lead time is quoted per project after the sample test, because it depends on how much customization each line needs."),
 ("Can bulk parts with polarity be fed in the right direction?", "Yes, when the polarity is physically recognizable. The SBF1001 bowl offers polarity sorting and lead cutting as options; the SBF2002 belt needs parts whose features can be told apart physically."),
 ("How are the feeders tested before shipment?", "Each catalog model carries a 48-hour continuous ageing test and 500 to 1,000 consecutive feeds without abnormality; the bowl feeder is run for 2 hours of continuous feeding."),
